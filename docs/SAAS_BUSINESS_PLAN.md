# PHOW SaaS Business Plan (Draft)

## 1) Snapshot
PHOW is an AI-powered analytics platform for small business owners. The product already includes multiple tools (Location Scout, Market Validator, Competitor Analyzer, Market Research, Review Responder, Social Media Coach) with a scalable backend architecture (FastAPI, Redis caching, background jobs, Supabase/Postgres, LangGraph agents).

This plan focuses on packaging those capabilities into a subscription SaaS with clear positioning, pricing, and a short-term go‑to‑market path.

## 2) Choose the Primary Wedge
Pick one core use case as the entry point. Two viable options:

### Option A: Daily Operations Assistant (recommended)
- **Primary tools:** Review Responder + Social Media Coach + Local Pulse
- **Value:** Daily time savings + better customer responses + consistent marketing
- **Best ICP:** Single-location owner‑operators (restaurants, cafes, salons, clinics, gyms, repair shops)

### Option B: Launch/Expansion Intelligence
- **Primary tools:** Location Scout + Market Research + Competitor Analyzer
- **Value:** Avoid costly location mistakes + higher confidence in expansion decisions
- **Best ICP:** New business owners or multi‑location operators evaluating new sites

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A for daily engagement and retention, then upsell Option B as a premium report or add‑on.

## 3) Pricing & Packaging (credits-based)
Keep pricing accessible for SMBs while protecting margins against API usage.

### Suggested Tiers
- **Starter** ($29–$49/month per location)
  - Daily tools
  - Limited monthly credits for deep analysis

- **Growth** ($99–$149/month per location)
  - Higher credit pool
  - Weekly insights and report exports

- **Agency / Multi‑Location** ($249+/month)
  - Multiple locations + team seats
  - Client workspaces and higher usage limits

### Credit System
- **Daily tools** (reviews + social) consume minimal or zero credits
- **Heavy tools** (market research, competitor analysis) consume more credits
- Clear usage meter in the dashboard

---

## 4) Compliance & Data Licensing (must address)
You already use Google Maps and Yelp. Both have strict rules about attribution, caching, and data usage. The product must:
- Maintain platform attribution
- Avoid long‑term storage of restricted data
- Avoid blending or re‑publishing restricted content without proper compliance

---

## 5) Go‑to‑Market (low‑cost, fast feedback)
Focus on channels that reach SMB owners directly:

1) **Local SEO & Content**
   - “How to respond to negative reviews”
   - “Best place to open a coffee shop in [city]”

2) **Agency Partnerships**
   - Marketing agencies who manage reviews and social for SMBs

3) **Local Business Orgs**
   - Chambers of commerce, local meetups, small‑business events

4) **Lead Magnet**
   - Free 1‑time market report or review response bundle

---

## 6) 30‑60‑90 Day Execution Plan

### Next 30 Days
- Choose ICP + primary wedge
- Add billing and plan gating (Stripe or equivalent)
- Implement usage tracking + credits
- Launch “daily tools” bundle (Review Responder + Social Media Coach)

---

## 8) Open Questions
To finalize positioning and packaging:
1) Which SMB niche do you want to target first?
2) Daily operations assistant vs. expansion intelligence — which wedge first?
3) Self‑serve SMB or agency‑led sales?

---
